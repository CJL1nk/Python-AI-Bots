# Python-AI-Bots
Random bots made with various APIs such as openAI and Diffusers

Make sure you have the required modules installed.
Each bot directory has an INSTALLS.txt file with the commands to install everything required
just press that green button with download code and YEAH woohoo u got the stuff


The image bot wont work above python 3.9, as pytoch isn't compatible with anything above it yet

that's about it thanks
